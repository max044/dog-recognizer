# dog-recognizer
The proposed project is to develop an AI iPhone app that can accurately recognize different dog breeds from a photo.

## Idea for swift project:

### Main features:
- Create an AI iPhone app that can recognize a dog breed
- Use pytorch to create the neural network and convert it using CoreML
- Allow the user to take a photo or import a photo of a dog for breed identification
- Include a historic page that displays previously identified dog breeds

### Additional Features:
- Add a feature to search for information about the recognized dog breed, such as temperament, size, and lifespan
- Implement a feature that enables users to save identified dogs to a personal collection within the app, along with notes and photos
- Include a feature to find nearby dog parks, veterinarians, and other dog-related businesses based on the recognized breed
- Add a social aspect to the app, wherein users can share their identified dogs and collections with their friends and followers on social media platforms such as Instagram or Twitter.
- Use location-based services to find nearby dog parks, veterinarians, and other dog-related businesses based on the recognized breed.

### Technical scope:
- SwiftUI
- Pytorch
- CoreML
- Database system
- API
